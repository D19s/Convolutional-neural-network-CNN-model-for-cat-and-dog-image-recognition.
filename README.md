# Convolutional-neural-network-CNN-model-for-cat-and-dog-image-recognition.

- Utilized TensorFlow and Keras libraries to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can differentiate between cats and dogs in images.
- Implemented various preprocessing methods such as image augmentation to adjust, flip, and magnify the training data to avoid overfitting and improve dataset diversity.
- Constructed a fully connected CNN model with two layers of convolution and pooling, followed by flattening. 
- Trained the CNN model with ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 93.60% after 30 epochs.
